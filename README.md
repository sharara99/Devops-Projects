# DevOps Projects

Welcome to my DevOps Projects repository! This repository contains various projects that I have worked on to apply and demonstrate my skills in DevOps, cloud computing, and infrastructure automation. These projects are a culmination of the knowledge I've gained from my internships, training programs, and self-study.

## About

I am currently engaged in two internships:

1. **DevOps Engineer Internship at Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative (DEPI):** Here, I work on automating infrastructure and managing cloud resources using various DevOps tools and practices.

2. **Software Engineering Internship at Manara:** This program focuses on system design, cloud computing, and preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies.

Through these internships, I have gained hands-on experience in AWS Cloud, Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and more. This repository is a place where I consolidate my learning by working on real-world projects.
